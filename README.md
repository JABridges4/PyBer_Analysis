# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to compare data from urban cities to suburban and rural cities in order to see how city type affected prices, and to see if any cities are currently being under served.

## Results
My analysis shows that there are far more rides given in urban cities. There are 1625 rides from urban cities, compared to 625 in suburban cities and 125 in rural cities. There are also far more drivers in urban cities than any other place. There are 2405 drivers in urban cities, 490 dirvers in suburban cities, and just 78 in rural cities. However, the average fare is significantly more in rural cities, as there are fewer drivers available at any given moment. The average fare in rural cities is $34.62 while that number drops to $30.97 in suburban cities and drops again to $24.53 in urban cities.

## Summary
Based on my analysis I have three recommendations. The first is to try to get more drivers outside of urban areas. This will make the price drop for PyBer users and will expand the business to places with fewer options. Another recommendation would be to try to get more people to use the app in urban areas. There seems to be an abundance of drivers, so there is potential for growth it we can expand on the user side of the business. I would also recommend getting population for each city so that further analysis could be conducted on a per-capita basis.
